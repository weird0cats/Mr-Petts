The idea is:
- pet system for bot
- new bot (later) for administration
- adjustments to `jsonfs` as it's still pretty new

[[The idea.canvas|The idea]] 
As the canvas can't explain, each pet will be stored in a separate file, this file will be named using the user's ID, this makes it easier to link the pet to its owner, as your ID is constant. If a user account is lost, I am able to recover their pet and relink it to their ID.
# Why?
I just felt like it
# How?
Don't ask _me_ how!
