# Mr. Petts
This bot is just a sort of pet simulator on discord, it was supposed to be administrative, but discord didn't like that.

This project uses [Nextcord](https://nextcord.dev/), a general purpose discord API wrapper, see more in their description. 
If you want to contribute, I'll look at pull requests, but why would you submit a pull request for a joke?
