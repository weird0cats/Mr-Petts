# Some bot
I'm making a discord bot to both relearn API magic and to learn the git platform, I am simply messing around with this creation. I might make something serious someday.

Kinda, kinda not, we'll see!
This project uses [Nextcord](https://nextcord.dev/), a general purpose discord API wrapper, see more in their description.
